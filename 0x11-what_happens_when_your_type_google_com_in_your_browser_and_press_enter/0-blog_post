The URL https://www.google.com consists of four parts

https: →Protocol used to access resource

www → The subdomain

google → the Domain name

.com → Top-Level Domain. It indicates the purpose or type of the website

When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press enter it engages a Domain Name System(DNS) recursive lookup. It first checks in the the cache of the browser for the IP address and if it is not found, it extends to the OS and if necessary in the internet service provider(ISP) . If not found, an error is returned.

Once the domain name is translated to IP address a Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) connection is established with the Google web servers. TCP works as follows.

a). The computer sends SYN(synchronize) packets to the google web server through a firewall that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic requesting a session.

b). Google using load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers for optimal resource utilization.

c). Google opens a port and accepts the connection by sending back SYN/ACK (synchronize acknowledged) packet.

d). The client acknowledges by sending an ACK packet to the server after which the browser initiates an SSL connection for secure exchange of data without fear of interception . The SSL 3-way handshake which ensures secure communication by verifying authenticity of the connection occurs at this stage. This can be verified by looking at the SSL badge mentioned on the top of the URL.

The browser sends a HTTP get request to the google web server asking for the content of google.com. The web server receives the request and forwards it to Google's application servers which interacts with databases that serve dynamic content then sends back a response with the html and other cached static files which help load web pages faster upon revisiting with a status code 200 meaning it was successful then the user can see the google search page.
