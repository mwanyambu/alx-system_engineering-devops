Power Outage Postmortem - Incident on 22-01-2000

Issue Summary:

Duration:-The power outage occurred on January 22, 2000, starting at 19:00 hrs in GMT+3 timezone and persisted for an hour. This outage impacted our cellular network service, resulting in disruptions for 70% of users.

Impact:-The cellular network service experienced complete downtime during the outage, causing connectivity issues and dropped calls for affected users.Approximately 70% of our users reported disruptions in their cellular services during the incident.

Root Cause:-The root cause of the outage was identified as a widespread power outage that affected the data center hosting critical components of our cellular network infrastructure.

Timeline:
Detection Time:-The power outage was immediately detected at 19:00 hrs through real-time monitoring as servers and network equipment abruptly went offline.
Actions Taken:-Swift investigation focused on assessing the extent of the impact on our cellular network service.Initial assumptions were made based on the sudden loss of power.

Misleading Paths:-Given the nature of the outage, there were no misleading paths in this case as the issue was external and evident.

Escalation:-The incident was escalated to the data center management and facilities team for immediate action.

Resolution:- Power was gradually restored by the data center's backup generators. Following power restoration, cellular network systems were systematically brought back online to ensure stability.





Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:-The core issue was the external power outage, which affected our data center's operations, subsequently impacting our cellular network infrastructure.

Resolution:-The resolution involved the gradual restoration of power through backup generators and the systematic reactivation of cellular network systems once power was stabilized.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:-Conduct a thorough audit of the data center's power infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and propose improvements. Explore the feasibility of implementing additional redundant power sources to minimize the impact of external power outages.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Power Infrastructure Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of the data center's power infrastructure to identify and rectify vulnerabilities.
Redundant Power Sources Exploration:** Investigate and implement redundant power sources to enhance the resilience of our infrastructure against future power outages.

This postmortem provides a technical analysis of the power outage incident on January 22, 2000, detailing the root cause, resolution, and measures to fortify our infrastructure against similar incidents.
